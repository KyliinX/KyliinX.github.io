      <description>&lt;p&gt;During my first co-op at &lt;strong&gt;Chongqing University Electrical Engineering Lab&lt;/strong&gt; from Janurary 2023 to April 2023, I had the opportunity to work on an exciting project involving energy consumption mode mining and exception identification of power users. My advisor is Professor &lt;a href=&#34;https://cee.cqu.edu.cn/szdw/jslb/y__j.htm&#34;&gt;Juan Yu&lt;/a&gt;. This experience gave me invaluable skills and insights that shaped my approach to machine learning and research. Here&amp;rsquo;s a detailed look at what I learned and accomplished during this co-op:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From October 2021 to July 2022, I served as a cadre at the Association of Intelligent Vehicles and Opto-electronic Information at Chongqing University. During my time with the association, I had the opportunity to contribute to developing intelligent vehicle technologies, enhance my technical skills in microcontroller programming, and collaborate with fellow members on exciting projects related to trajectory cars. This experience enriched my understanding of the technical and organizational aspects of working in a student-led technical association.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
